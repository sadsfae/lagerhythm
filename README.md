pivo-tocene
===========

This is a simple Perl script which calls the twitter::lite
API and captures text via CGI then passes it along to twitter.

In order to utilize this you'd need to create a developer account
for twitter and then obtain the various secret keys needed.

This was originally hosted on Red Hat's 'Open Shift'
(http://www.openshift.com) and used to track the amount
of draft beer (pivo tocene) I consumed while in the Czech Republic
on work assignment.
